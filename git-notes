GIT & GITHUB

Module 1

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).
A repository (repo) contains project folders
A fork is a copy of a repo
Pull requests define changes that are commited and ready for review before being merged into the main branch
A commit is a snapshot in time of a project and a description of changes
A branch is a seperate line of development
A merge combines branches
Cloning creates a local copy of a remote Git repo

What is Git?
Git is a DVCS used to track changes to content . It provides a central point for collaboration and is amenable to Agile practices
Git allows for centralized project administration. Teams have controlled access. The central branch should be deployable code

What is Github?
Github is an online hosting service for Git repos. A repo is a data structure for storing documents with version control

Branching 
A branch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make changes. 
In the child branch, you can build, make edits, test the changes, and then merge them with the main branch. 
To ensure that changes are made by one member, do not impede or affect the workflow of other members, 
multiple branches can be created and merged with the main branch.
A pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits made to the main branch.
